**1. Model Fine-tuning**
We will:

. Load the dataset.
. Choose between gemma-7b-it or gemma-2b-it models (based on system limitations).
. Split the data into 300 samples for training and 30 for evaluation.
. Fine-tune the model to generate impressions based on the Report Name, History, and Observation fields.
**2. Model Evaluation**
After fine-tuning:
. Generate impressions using the 30 reserved samples.
. Compute:
  . Perplexity: A measure of how well the model predicts the test set.
  . ROUGE score: To evaluate the similarity between the generated and actual impressions.
**3. Text Analysis**
Perform analysis on the entire dataset (330 reports):
. Remove stop words.
. Apply stemming and lemmatization.
. Convert text into embeddings using a suitable model.
. Identify top 100 word pairs based on their embedding similarity.
**4. Visualization**
. Visualize the top 100 word pairs using a plot (e.g., scatterplot or heatmap).
. Optionally, create an interactive visualization using libraries like Plotly.
**5. Deliverables**
. Create a GitHub repository with all relevant code, documentation, and results.
. Provide the necessary evaluation results (perplexity and ROUGE scores).
. Include the visualization in the repository.

Let’s start by inspecting the dataset to understand its structure.Load and preview the CSV file to identify the columns and data types.

The dataset contains the following columns:

. Report Name: Name of the medical report (e.g., MRI, CT scan).
. History: Brief medical history or notes.
. Observation: Detailed medical observations.
. Impression: Summary or conclusion based on the observations (target for model generation).
**Next Steps:**
1. Data Preprocessing:
. Split the dataset into training (300 samples) and evaluation (30 samples).
2. Model Fine-tuning:
. Fine-tune the model using the Report Name, History, and Observation fields to predict the Impression.

Let's proceed by splitting the dataset and preparing it for the fine-tuning process. ​​
The dataset has been successfully split into:
. 300 samples for training.
. 30 samples for evaluation.
